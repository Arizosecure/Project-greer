Project Greer: Malicious Domains and IPs List

Welcome to Project Greer, an initiative by ArizoSecure Technologies. This project provides a curated list of malicious domain names and IP addresses, aimed at aiding cybersecurity professionals, researchers, 
and enthusiasts in identifying and mitigating online threats. By sharing this information, we hope to contribute to the broader cybersecurity community and enhance collective threat intelligence.

Features:
Regularly updated list of malicious domains and IP addresses.
Categorization of threats based on type (e.g., phishing, malware, botnet).
Easy-to-use format for integration with various security tools and platforms.
Usage
The list can be used for:
Threat Detection: Security systems can use the list to block or monitor traffic from known malicious sources, preventing attacks like malware infections and phishing.

Network Security: Organizations can integrate the list into their security policies to automatically block dangerous traffic, reducing the risk of breaches.

Incident Response: The list helps security teams trace and mitigate the impact of cyberattacks by identifying the sources involved.

Threat Intelligence: Researchers can analyze the list to spot trends and anticipate future threats, improving overall security strategies.

Automated Tools: Security platforms can use the list to flag suspicious activities and maintain up-to-date defenses automatically.
